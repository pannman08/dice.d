# dice.d

This is a simple command-line dice roller I wrote entirely in the D programming language.

It rolls a 6-sided die using ASCII art.

## Requirements & Building

If you want to use dice.d for yourself, you need to download the Digital Mars D compiler at https://dlang.org/download.html and it's compatible with Linux, MacOS, and Windows terminals/command prompts.

Compile it using DMD:

```bash
dmd dice.d
```

This isn't my best work using D, this is just a little test thing I made in a day.
